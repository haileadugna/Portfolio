    <h1 style="background-color: lightgreen; color: blue;">Hello well come I am Haile Adugna</h1>
    <p style="background-color: lightgreen; color: blue;">
        I born and lived in small town known as 
        Sagure in Arsi zone Oromia Region Ethiopia.
        After completing grade 7 I moved to Assela city
         with my family. I pursued grade 8 at dosha elementary
         school and move to at chilalo highschool from grade 9 to 
         10 and at Assela preparatory school from grade 11 to 12.
         I scored 4.0 on my grade 10 matric exam and 548/700 
         on Ethiopian University Entrance Exam. In 2021 I joined 
         Addis Ababa University. Currenty, I am 2<sup>nd</sup> year
        pre-engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute Of Technology.

    <p style="background-color: lightgreen; color: blue;">
        I am loyal to my country Ethiopia, Africa, and love my Family. 
        I enjoy reading, watching movies, listening to music and coding. 
        In the future I want to be a Web developer and researcher.
         I am very excited to be what I want.
